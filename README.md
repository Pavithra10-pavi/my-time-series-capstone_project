Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Prophet and Deep Learning Hybrid Models

# 📈 Time Series Forecasting with Optimized Hybrid Prophet-LSTM Model

## 💡 Project Overview

This repository hosts a data science project focused on achieving highly accurate time series forecasting. It implements a *Hybrid Modeling Approach* that leverages the strengths of two distinct techniques:

1.  *Prophet Model:* Used as the base model to effectively capture the underlying trend and seasonality of the time series.
2.  *LSTM Neural Network:* A deep learning model used to predict and correct the residual errors (forecast errors) generated by the initial Prophet model.

The entire methodology, including rigorous hyperparameter tuning using the *Optuna* framework, is documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## ✨ Key Findings

The optimized Hybrid Prophet-LSTM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the standalone Prophet model, confirming that modeling the residuals significantly improves accuracy.
